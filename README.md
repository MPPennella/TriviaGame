# Overview

Players will be given a series of trivia questions to answer. Questions will be multiple-choice format, and each will present four possible answers. Questions will be drawn from a fixed list, but presented in a random order. The order of the answer choices will also be randomized. At the end, the player will receive a score summary.


# Game Flow

## Start Screen

Upon loading the page, the player will see a screen with a "Start" button before beginning the quiz. Once the button is clicked, the game will procede to the Question phase.

## Question

Players will be shown one question at a time, and will have a limited amount of time to answer each question. Question text will be shown, and there will be four buttons showing the four possible answer choices, which the player can select by clicking on them. Only one of the four answers will be correct. There will also be a countdown timer showing the remaining time that the player has to answer the question. Once the player has either selected an answer to the question or ran out of time, the game will progress to the Answer phase.

## Answer

Once the question phase is over, a new screen will state whether the player answered the preceding question correctly, incorrectly, or ran out of time. In all cases, the correct answer is displayed with an accompanying image. After a fixed amount of time, the game will proceed to another Question phase with a new question, or proceed to the Final Score phase if all questions have been asked.

## Final Score

After all questions have been answered, the player will receive a summary of their score, showing the breakdown of correct/incorrect/time-out results for the quiz. There will be a button giving the option to play again, which will reset the quiz to the first Question phase.
