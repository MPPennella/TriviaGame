# TriviaGame
A trivia game with timed questions

# Specifications

Players will be given a series of trivia questions to answer. Questions will be multiple-choice format, and each will present four possible answers. Questions will be drawn from a fixed list, but presented in a random order. The order of the answer choices will also be randomized.

Players will be shown one question at a time, and will have a limited amount of time to answer each question. Once the player has either answered the question or ran out of time, the answer will be revealed with an accompanying image. After a fixed amount of time, the game will proceed to the next question. After all questions have been answered, the player will receive a summary of their score, and the option to play again.
